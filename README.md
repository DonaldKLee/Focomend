# Focomend
Focomend is a Chrome Extension that filters out your YouTube reccomendations and hide comments! This prevents distractions and helps you stay on track when watching YouTube. 

# Installation and Set up

  - Go to line 1 where you will see a list called "keywords"
  - The words in that list will be used when filtering out videos. Only videos with those words will be shown to you!
